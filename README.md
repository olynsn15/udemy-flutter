# Udemy Flutter Projects

This repository contains several Flutter projects that I developed while following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's comprehensive Flutter course on Udemy:

[Learn Flutter & Dart to Build iOS & Android Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/?couponCode=ST19MT280525G1)

These projects helped me gain practical experience in building cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter and Dart.
